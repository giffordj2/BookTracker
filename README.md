# BookTracker
This is a console application that will allow the user to recommend a book or view books recommended by others. The app allows the user to keep recommending or viewing books until
they decide to exit the app. The recommended books are pulled from a JSON file and after exiting the user's list of recommended books are then added to the file.

Features Implemented:
\n-Implements a “master loop” where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
\n-Creates a list, populates it with several values, retrieves at least one value, and uses it in the program.
\n-Reads data from an external JSON file and uses that data in the application.
\n-Implements a Regex to valiadate user input.
